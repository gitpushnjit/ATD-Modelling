# Background
The article by Jan Dietz “The Deep Structure of Business Processes,” presented his Actor Transaction Diagram (ATD) for business process modeling, which is a term he uses in another article. He calls the top diagram the Essential Map (using Molecular Building Blocks) and the bottom one the Atomic Level (using Atomic Building Blocks). We will simplify things and call them the Top Level ATD and the bottom one the Detail Level ATD, respectively.
